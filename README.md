Small game jam project made for the [mini jame gam 44](https://itch.io/jam/mini-jame-gam-44). It features plenty of hectic fun, as you try your best to make the highest profit you are able in a set emount of time.

It is still in development on the side, with plans of having it turn into a mobile game, you can play casually to kill time and compete with friends. Planning to be finished by the end of October
